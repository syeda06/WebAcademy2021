  <p>I thought about the different movies I watched over the last 3 years and decided which ones were my favorites. I came up with "Train To Busan", "Five Feet Apart", and "Raees". After I chose my movies, I chose the color "Light Blue" because I liked the way it looked and fit on my project.
  <br>
  The way I brainstormed was that I sat at my seat and thought over the past 3 years of my movie watching experiences. I chose the movies that made me really emotional. After I chose my movies, I chose the colors that looked really appealing to me and decorated my project using those colors.
  <br>
  Along the way, I learned that I rank movies as my favorites based on how much it affects my feelings. A good movie would have to either make me super happy or make me cry at least once. So, I learned a little bit about myself.
  <br>
  The hardest part of this project was trying to connect the links to each photo and to insert the images into the project. Sometimes, the image wouldn't show up or the links would send me to an error page.
  <br>
  I resolved it by checking over my mistakes and code over and over again until it worked. After it started working again, I moved onto the next stage of my project, fixing any little mistakes along the way.
