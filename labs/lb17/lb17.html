      Career choices are ones that are usually picked when especially young or during high-school as choices may vary when you grow up. I don't exactly know what I want to do when I grow up but I have an idea. Here's my plan so far:
    </p>

      So my main choice of jobs was to become a detective. I've always been interested in that line of work whether it be a police officer or something similar. I chose detective specifically because it's more private and independent as I'm allowed to work the way I want, without worrying over my peers and team entirely. I like to look at things by what caused them, what happened, and what was the result. I like the flow of the order and sequence as it makes sense and fits perfectly. Besides that, let's get a bit more realistic. I have to have at least a bachelor's or associates degree in law, forensic science, law enforcement, criminal justice, crime scene investigation. Plus, I heard that I have to have at least 4-5 years of experience in the NYPD before I can actually become a detective.

      Anyways, if that doesn't work out, due to multiple reasons including religion purposes, I want to work as a teacher as a backup plan. I don't mind working in an elementary school or a high school, but I definitely don't want to work in a middle school. I wouldn't want to deal wiht the kids growing out of their childish stages and into their more mature stages. It would be a lot to take care of and I would rather work with children or teenagers.
