		<p> The different tags all have their own meaning. "h1" means heading 1. "p" means paragraph. When putting the tags in between the angled brackets (<, >), it is a command that allows the computer to know what to do. Every time a heading is added to the webpage, the font gradually becomes smaller. </p>
		<p> I am here because my schedule brought me into this class, however, I feel more interested now that I tried it out. Why I'm here at Edison is because I wanted to get into the Visual Arts program. I also, came to Edison because my older brother graduated from here last year. As for what I want to achieve, I want to be able to pass all my classes and eventually go to a good college. No particular college for now but a good college for my future. I want to have a successful future in a business career or a career in the FBI.
